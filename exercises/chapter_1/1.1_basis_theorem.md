# 1.1 Problem Statement

Suppose that the two sets $`\{ a_1,\dots, a_m \}`$ and $`\{b1,\dots, bn \}`$ form bases for the same vector space, and suppose initially that $m > n$. By establishing a contradiction, prove the _basis theorem_ that all bases of a vector space have the same number of elements.

## Solution Explanation

To prove that all bases of a (nonzero) vector space $V$ have the same number of elements, we use a **proof by contradiction**. The key idea is that a spanning set cannot have fewer vectors than any linearly independent set of the same space. Below is a standard proof outline using this approach.

## Statement to Prove

**Basis Theorem:**  
If $`\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m\}`$ and $`\{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\}`$ are both bases for the same vector space $V$, then $m = n$.

---

## Proof by Contradiction

1. **Assumption**  
   Assume, for contradiction, that $`\{a_1, \dots, a_m\}`$ and $`\{b_1, \dots, b_n\}`$ are bases of $V$, but $m > n$.

2. **Properties of a Basis**  
   Recall two important facts about a basis:
   - **Spanning:** If $`\{b_1, \dots, b_n\}`$ is a basis, then **every** vector in $V$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the $b_i$'s.
   - **Linear Independence:** The vectors in a basis are linearly independent; none of them can be written as a linear combination of the others.

3. **Expressing $a_1$ in Terms of the $b_i$'s**  
   Since $`\{b_1, \dots, b_n\}`$ spans $V$, each $a_i$ (in particular $a_1$) can be written as a linear combination of the $b_i$'s. Thus, there exist scalars $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \dots, \alpha_{n}$ such that

$$ a_1 = \alpha_{1} b_1 + \alpha_{2} b_2 + \cdots + \alpha_{n} b_n. $$
   
   At least one of $\alpha_{j}$ must be nonzero (otherwise $a_1$ would be the zero vector, contradicting linear independence if it’s part of a basis).

5. **Construct a New Set of $n$ Vectors**  
   Suppose $\alpha_k \neq 0$. We can solve for $b_k$:
   
$$ b_k = \frac{1}{\alpha_k} \left( a_1 - \alpha_{1}b_1 - \cdots - \alpha_{k-1}b_{k-1} - \alpha_{k+1} b_{k+1} - \cdots - \alpha_n b_n \right).$$

   In other words, $b_k$ is now expressed as a linear combination of
   
$$ a_1, \; b_1, \dots, b_{k-1}, b_{k+1}, \dots, b_n. $$

   Replace $b_k$ in the set $\{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\}$ with $a_1$.  
   Define
   
$$ B' = \{b_1, \dots, b_{k-1}, \; a_1, \; b_{k+1}, \dots, b_n\}. $$

   - **Spanning Argument:** The set $B'$ still **spans** the entire space $V$. Any vector in $V$ can still be written in terms of these $n$ vectors (because we effectively “swapped” $b_k$ for $a_1$, and $b_k$ can be written in terms of $a_1$ and the remaining $b_i$'s).

7. **Repeat the Process**  
   Next, use the same argument to replace $b_j$ with $a_2$, then $a_3$, and so on. Since $`\{a_1, \dots, a_m\}`$ has $m$ vectors and we have only $n$ “slots” in the spanning set, but $m > n$, you will eventually run out of $b_i$'s to swap out if you try to accommodate all the $a_i$'s.

8. **Contradiction via Linear Independence**  
   By the end of this swapping process, you would try to fit more than $n$$ linearly independent vectors (the original $a_i$'s) into a set of size $n$, which is impossible. In more precise terms:
   - If $m > n$, then $`\{a_1, \dots, a_m\}`$ has more vectors than the spanning set has “slots.”  
   - But we also know that any spanning set must have **at least as many** vectors as a basis with more vectors (because any basis is a maximal linearly independent set).

   This conflict shows that you cannot have $m > n$. The same argument (swapping roles) shows you cannot have $n > m$ either.

9. **Conclusion: $m = n$**  
   The only possibility that avoids contradiction is $m = n$. Hence, **all bases of a vector space have the same number of elements**.

## Key Takeaways

1. **No Fewer Vectors**  
   A spanning set cannot have **fewer** vectors than any linearly independent set. If you try to compress it too far, you lose the ability to span the entire space.

2. **No More Vectors**  
   A linearly independent set cannot be strictly larger than a spanning set, or else those extra vectors would violate the requirement that bases are maximal independent sets (and minimal spanning sets).

3. **Consistency of Dimension**  
   This result justifies the definition of the **dimension** of a vector space: the size of any (and hence every) basis of the space.

Thus, by contradiction, assuming $m \neq n$$ leads to an impossibility with either spanning or independence, forcing us to conclude that $m = n$. This completes the proof.
