# Problem 1.2

Demonstrate that the following define vector spaces:

- **(a)** The set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to $n$.
- **(b)** All solutions of a given linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.
- **(c)** The set of all $n \times m$ matrices.

# Solution

To show that each of the given sets forms a **vector space**, we must verify that they satisfy all the vector space axioms under the standard operations of addition and scalar multiplication. The key properties to check include:

1. **Closure under Addition:** The sum of any two elements in the set is also in the set.
2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying any element in the set by a scalar results in an element that is also in the set.
3. **Existence of an Additive Identity:** There exists an element (zero vector) in the set such that adding it to any element in the set leaves the element unchanged.
4. **Existence of Additive Inverses:** For every element in the set, there exists another element in the set that when added together yield the additive identity.
5. **Other Axioms:** Associativity, commutativity of addition, distributive properties, etc., which generally follow from the underlying field properties.

## Part (a): The Set of All Polynomials of Degree Less Than or Equal to $n$

### Definition of the Set

Let

$$ P_n = \lbrace p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots + a_n x^n \mid a_i \in \mathbb{R} \rbrace $$

be the set of all polynomials of degree at most $n$.

### Verification of Vector Space Properties

1. **Closure under Addition:**
   - Let $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n$ and $q(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + \dots + b_n x^n$ be in $P_n$.
   - Their sum is

$$ p(x) + q(x) = (a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1)x + \dots + (a_n + b_n)x^n $$

   which is also a polynomial of degree at most $n$. Thus, $P_n$ is closed under addition.

2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**
   - Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n$ be in $P_n$.
   - The scalar multiple is

$$ \alpha p(x) = (\alpha a_0) + (\alpha a_1)x + \dots + (\alpha a_n)x^n $$

   which is also a polynomial of degree at most $n$. Thus, $P_n$ is closed under scalar multiplication.

3. **Additive Identity:**
   - The zero polynomial $0(x) = 0 + 0x + \dots + 0x^n$ serves as the additive identity in $P_n$.

4. **Additive Inverses:**
   - For any $p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n$ in $P_n$, the additive inverse is $-p(x) = (-a_0) + (-a_1)x + \dots + (-a_n)x^n$, which is also in $P_n$.

5. **Other Axioms:**
   - Associativity and commutativity of addition, distributive properties, and compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication hold naturally from the properties of real numbers.

### Conclusion

Since all vector space axioms are satisfied, $P_n$ is a vector space.

## Part (b): All Solutions of a Given Linear Homogeneous Ordinary Differential Equation

### Definition of the Set

Consider a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form

$$ L \lbrace y \rbrace = 0 $$

where $L$ is a linear differential operator. Let $S$ denote the set of all solutions $y(x)$ to this ODE.

### Verification of Vector Space Properties

1. **Closure under Addition:**
   - Let $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ be solutions in $S$, i.e., $L \lbrace y_1 \rbrace  = 0$ and $L \lbrace y_2 \rbrace  = 0$.
   - Since $L$ is linear,

$$ L \lbrace y_1 + y_2 \rbrace  = L \lbrace y_1 \rbrace  + L \lbrace y_2 \rbrace  = 0 + 0 = 0 $$

   Hence, $y_1(x) + y_2(x)$ is also a solution in $S$.

2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**
   - Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $y(x) \in S$, i.e., $L \lbrace y \rbrace  = 0$.
   - Then,

$$ L \lbrace \alpha y \rbrace  = \alpha L \lbrace y \rbrace  = \alpha \cdot 0 = 0 $$
    
   Thus, $\alpha y(x)$ is also in $S$.

3. **Additive Identity:**
   - The zero function $y(x) = 0$ satisfies $L \lbrace 0 \rbrace  = 0$, so it is in $S$.

4. **Additive Inverses:**
   - For any $y(x) \in S$, the function $-y(x)$ satisfies

$$ L \lbrace -y \rbrace  = -L \lbrace y \rbrace  = -0 = 0 $$

   Hence, $-y(x)$ is also in $S$.

5. **Other Axioms:**
   - Associativity and commutativity of addition, distributive properties, and compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication hold due to the linearity of $L$ and the properties of real numbers.

### Conclusion

The set $S$ of all solutions to a linear homogeneous ODE is a vector space.

## Part (c): The Set of All $n \times m$ Matrices

### Definition of the Set

Let

$$ M_{n \times m} = \lbrace A \mid A \text{ is an } n \times m \text{ matrix with real entries} \rbrace $$

be the set of all $n \times m$ real matrices.

### Verification of Vector Space Properties

1. **Closure under Addition:**
   - Let $A, B \in M_{n \times m}$.
   - Their sum $A + B$ is defined by

$$ (A + B)_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij} \quad \text{for all} 1 \leq i \leq n,\, 1 \leq j \leq m $$

   which is also an $n \times m$ matrix. Thus, $M_{n \times m}$ is closed under addition.

2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication:**
   - Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $A \in M_{n \times m}$.
   - The scalar multiple $\alpha A$ is defined by

$$ \alpha A_{ij} = \alpha \cdot A_{ij} \quad \textbf{for all } 1 \leq i \leq n,\, 1 \leq j \leq m $$

   which is also an $n \times m$ matrix. Thus, $M_{n \times m}$ is closed under scalar multiplication.

3. **Additive Identity:**
   - The zero matrix $0$ with all entries zero serves as the additive identity in $M_{n \times m}$.

4. **Additive Inverses:**
   - For any matrix $A \in M_{n \times m}$, the matrix $-A$ defined by

$$ -A_{ij} = -A_{ij} \quad \text{for all } 1 \leq i \leq n,\, 1 \leq j \leq m $$

   is the additive inverse of $A$ and is also in $M_{n \times m}$.

5. **Other Axioms:**
   - Associativity and commutativity of addition, distributive properties, and compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication hold naturally from the properties of real numbers applied to each entry of the matrices.

### Conclusion

Since all vector space axioms are satisfied, $M_{n \times m}$ is a vector space.

# Key Takeaways

1. **Verification of Vector Space Properties:** To establish that a set is a vector space, systematically verify closure under addition and scalar multiplication, the existence of an additive identity and inverses, and other axioms.

2. **Polynomials as Vector Spaces:** The set of polynomials of degree at most $n$ forms a finite-dimensional vector space with dimension $n+1$.

3. **Solution Spaces of Linear Homogeneous ODEs:** These solution sets are inherently vector spaces due to the linearity of the differential operator, allowing for superposition of solutions.

4. **Matrix Spaces:** The collection of all $n \times m$ matrices over a field (e.g., $\mathbb{R}$) forms a vector space, which is fundamental in linear algebra and its applications.
