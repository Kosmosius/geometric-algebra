**Solution Explanation**

Show that the set  

$$ \lbrace \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k \rbrace $$

forms a (discrete) group under quaternion multiplication. This set is often denoted $Q_8$, the *quaternion group* of order 8. Let’s verify the group axioms and then discuss why it is discrete.

## 1. Group Axioms

1. **Closure**  
   We must show that multiplying any two elements of $H$ results in another element of $H$. Recall the basic quaternion multiplication rules among the units $i, j, k$:

$$ i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 \quad\text{and}\quad ij = k, \quad jk = i, \quad ki = j, $$

   with the additional rules $ji = -k$, etc., from anti-commutativity. One checks all products $\alpha \beta$ for $\alpha, \beta \in \lbrace \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k \rbrace$ remain in $\lbrace \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k \rbrace$. For example:

   - $i \cdot i = -1 \in H$.  
   - $i \cdot j = k \in H$.  
   - $(-j) \cdot k = -j k = -i \in H$.

   Because each product of these units is again among $\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k$, the set $H$ is *closed* under quaternion multiplication.

2. **Associativity**  
   Quaternion multiplication is *associative* for all quaternions (a fundamental property of the quaternion algebra). Hence it is trivially associative on the subset $H$.

3. **Identity**  
   The identity element in the quaternions is $1$. Clearly $1 \in H$, and for every $x \in H$, we have $1 \cdot x = x \cdot 1 = x$. So $1$ is the identity for $H$.

4. **Inverses**  
   Every element in $H$ has an inverse in $H$. Indeed, for $\pm 1$, the inverse is itself since $1^{-1} = 1$ and $(-1)^{-1} = -1$. For the units $\pm i, \pm j, \pm k$, one checks that

$$ i \cdot (-i) = -i^2 = 1, \quad \text{so } i^{-1} = -i \in H, $$

   and similarly for $j$ and $k$ (plus their negative versions). Thus every element has an inverse within $H$.

Hence, $H$ satisfies all four axioms of a group, making it a (non-abelian) group of order 8.

## 2. Why Is It Discrete?

A subset of a topological space (here, the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$ with the usual Euclidean topology $\mathbb{R}^4$) is called *discrete* if every point in the subset is isolated—informally, no point “accumulates” to another.  

Since $\{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$ is a *finite* set, each of its points is clearly isolated (you can put a small open ball around each point that contains no other points of $H$). Consequently, $H$ (which is also known as $Q_8$) is a **finite** group and therefore **discrete** in the standard topology on the quaternions.

## 3. Summary

1. **Closure**: All products of elements remain in $\lbrace \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k \rbrace$.  
2. **Associativity**: Follows from quaternion multiplication.  
3. **Identity**: $1$ is the identity.  
4. **Inverses**: Each element $\pm i, \pm j, \pm k$ has an inverse in $H$.  
5. **Discreteness**: $H$ is a finite set, hence forms a discrete subset of $\mathbb{H}$.

Thus, $\lbrace \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k \rbrace$ is a (discrete) group under quaternion multiplication, commonly known as the quaternion group $Q_8$.
