# 1.5 

The unit quaternions $i, j, k$ are generators of rotations about their respective axes. Are rotations through either π or π/2 consistent with the equation $ijk = −1$?

First, let us restate the question in more precise terms:

We know that in the quaternion algebra $\Bbb H$, the (purely imaginary) unit quaternions 
$$
i,\quad j,\quad k
$$
satisfy the product relation
$$
i\,j\,k \;=\;-1.
$$

On the other hand, when we use unit quaternions to represent rotations in $\Bbb R^3$, 
a unit quaternion $q = \cos(\tfrac{\theta}{2}) + \sin(\tfrac{\theta}{2})(x i + y j + z k)$ 
corresponds to the rotation by angle $\theta$ about the axis $(x,y,z)$.  

Are the quaternions $i,j,k$ more naturally interpreted as rotations by $\pi$ (180°) 
or by $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ (90°) around the $x,y,z$-axes, and how does that choice relate 
to the product identity $i j k = -1$?

## 1. How Quaternions Encode Rotations

A unit quaternion
$$
q \;=\; \cos\!\bigl(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\bigr) \;+\; \sin\!\bigl(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\bigr)\,\Bigl(x\,i \;+\; y\,j \;+\; z\,k\Bigr),
$$
with $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$,  
represents a rotation in $\Bbb R^3$ by an angle $\theta$ around the unit axis $(x,y,z)$.  

- The $\cos(\theta/2)$ part is the **real component**.  
- The vector $(x,y,z)$ in front of $i,j,k$ is the **rotation axis**.  
- The angle is $\theta = 2\arccos\bigl(\mathrm{Re}(q)\bigr)$.

Hence:

- **Purely imaginary quaternion** $p = x\,i + y\,j + z\,k$ with no real part means $\cos(\tfrac{\theta}{2})=0$.  
- So $\mathrm{Re}(p)=0\implies \cos(\tfrac{\theta}{2})=0\implies \tfrac{\theta}{2} = \tfrac{\pi}{2}\implies \theta = \pi.$

**Conclusion:** A purely imaginary unit quaternion always represents a rotation of $\pi$ (180°) around its corresponding axis in $\Bbb R^3$.

## 2. Interpreting $i, j, k$

1. Each of the standard quaternion units $i, j, k$ has:
   $$
   i = 0 + 1\cdot i \quad\Longrightarrow\quad |i|=1,\;\mathrm{Re}(i)=0,
   $$
   and similarly for $j, k$.

2. By the rotation formula above, 
   $\displaystyle i = \sin\!\bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{2}\bigr)\,i + \cos\!\bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{2}\bigr)\cdot 1 = (0) + (1)\cdot i$
   corresponds to **a rotation of 180° about the $x$-axis** in 3D space.  
   Likewise $j$ is 180° about the $y$-axis, and $k$ is 180° about the $z$-axis.

Therefore:

- **$i, j, k$ are naturally identified with $\pi$-rotations** (i.e., half-turns) around the respective Cartesian axes $x,y,z$.

## 3. Checking $i j k = -1$ Under These Rotations

In the quaternion algebra, we have the well-known identities
$$
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.
$$

- Algebraically, $i j k = -1$ follows from $i j = k$ and hence $i j k = k k = k^2 = -1$.  

But what does $-1$ mean as a rotation?

1. As a quaternion, $-1$ has:
   $$
   -1 \;=\; \cos(\tfrac{\theta}{2}) + \sin(\tfrac{\theta}{2})(\,0\,i + 0\,j + 0\,k)
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad 
   \cos(\tfrac{\theta}{2}) = -1,\; \sin(\tfrac{\theta}{2})=0.
   $$
2. Solving $\cos(\tfrac{\theta}{2})=-1$ gives $\tfrac{\theta}{2}=\pi\implies \theta=2\pi$.  

Hence, **as a rotation in 3D**, the quaternion $-1$ corresponds to a $2\pi$-rotation, i.e., the **identity transformation** in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$.  

In other words, in the “spin” or “double cover” picture (where unit quaternions live in $\mathrm{Spin}(3)$),  
$+1$ and $-1$ are **different** elements but both project to the **same** rotation (the identity) in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$.

Thus composing the three half-turns about $x,y,z$-axes (in that order) corresponds (in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$) to the identity rotation—consistent with $i j k = -1$ in the quaternions.

## 4. What If We Tried $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ (90°) Rotations?

Suppose someone tries to interpret $i$ as a rotation by 90° about the $x$-axis.  Then:

- The corresponding unit quaternion would be
  $$
  q = \cos\Bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{4}\Bigr) + \sin\Bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{4}\Bigr)\,i 
      \;=\;\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\,i,
  $$
  which **is not** purely imaginary (notice the nonzero real part $\sqrt{2}/2$).  

- Algebraically, this quaternion is $\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\,i\neq i$.  

Therefore, the **pure imaginary** quaternion $i$ cannot represent a 90° rotation about $x$; it must represent a 180° rotation.

---
## 5. Final Answer

- **Yes**, the equation $i j k = -1$ is **perfectly consistent** if $i, j, k$ are taken to be 180° (i.e., $\pi$-) rotations about the $x,y,z$-axes.  
- **No**, interpreting $i, j, k$ as 90° (i.e., $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$-) rotations about $x,y,z$ is **not** consistent with the purely imaginary form of $i,j,k$ or with the product identity $i j k = -1$.

Hence the correct geometric interpretation is that each of $i, j, k$ corresponds to a half-turn ($\pi$-rotation) about its respective axis, and their product $i j k = -1$ aligns with the fact that $-1$ in the quaternion group is (in 3D terms) a full $2\pi$-rotation (the identity in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$).
