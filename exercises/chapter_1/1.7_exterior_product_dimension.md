# 1.7 Exterior Product Dimension

Prove that the dimension of the space formed by the exterior product
of m vectors drawn from a space of dimension n is

$$
\frac{n(n - 1) \dotsm (n - m +1)}{1 \cdot 2 \dotsm m} = \frac{n!}{(n - m)!m!}
$$

**Solution Explanation**

Let $V$ be a vector space of dimension $n$.  The $m$-th *exterior power* of $V$, denoted $\Lambda^m(V)$, is spanned by all *wedge products* (exterior products) of the form

$$
v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge \dots \wedge v_m
$$

where $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_m \in V$.  We aim to prove that

$$
\dim \Lambda^m(V) = \binom{n}{m} = \frac{n!}{(n - m)!\,m!}
= \frac{n(n - 1)\cdots (n - m +1)}{1\cdot 2 \cdots m}.
$$

## 1. Constructing a Basis for $\Lambda^m(V)$

A. **Choose a basis $\lbrace e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n \rbrace$ of $V$.**  
   Since $\dim(V) = n$, we can pick $n$ linearly independent vectors $e_1, \dots, e_n$.

B. **Consider wedge products of the basis vectors of length $m$.**  
   For each strictly increasing $m$-tuple $\lbrace i_1, i_2, \dots, i_m \rbrace$ with

$$
   1,\le i_1 <\, i_2 <\,\dots < i_m \le n
$$
   
   form the wedge product
  
$$
   e_{i_1} \wedge e_{i_2} \wedge \dots \wedge e_{i_m}.
$$

C. **Number of such wedge products.**  
   The number of ways to choose an ordered $m$-tuple $(i_1, \dots, i_m)$ with $i_1 < \dots < i_m$ out of $\lbrace 1,2,\dots,n \rbrace$ is exactly

$$
   \binom{n}{m}
   =\
   \frac{n!}{(n - m)!\,m!}
   =\
   \frac{n(n-1)\cdots (n - m +1)}{1\cdot 2 \cdots m}.
$$

   Thus, there are $\binom{n}{m}$ distinct “basic” wedge products.

D. **These wedge products form a basis for $\Lambda^m(V)$.**  
   - They *span* $\Lambda^m(V)$ because every wedge product $v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_m$ can be expressed (via linear combinations) in terms of wedge products of the basis vectors $e_i$.  
   - They are *linearly independent* because the exterior product is *antisymmetric*, and any linear combination that vanishes implies the coefficients must be zero.  (A more rigorous argument involves writing these wedge products in coordinates and observing they correspond to distinct positions in a fully antisymmetric tensor.)

Therefore, the family 
$\lbrace e_{i_1}\wedge e_{i_2}\wedge \dots \wedge e_{i_m} \rbrace_{1\le i_1< i_2<\cdots<i_m\le n}$  
is a basis of $\Lambda^m(V)$ and has exactly $\binom{n}{m}$ elements.

## 2. Conclusion

Since we have exhibited $\binom{n}{m}$ basis elements that are linearly independent and span $\Lambda^m(V)$, it follows that

$$
\dim \Lambda^m(V) 
=\
\binom{n}{m}
=\
\frac{n!}{(n - m)! \, m!}
=\
\frac{n(n - 1)\dots (n - m +1)}{1 \cdot 2 \dots m}.
$$

That proves the dimension formula for the $m$-th exterior power of an $n$-dimensional vector space.
