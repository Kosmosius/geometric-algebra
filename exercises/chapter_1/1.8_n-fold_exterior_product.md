# 1.8 n-fold Exterior Product

Prove that the n-fold exterior product of a set of n dependent vectors is zero.

**Solution Explanation**

Let $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ be vectors in an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$. We want to prove:

If $v_1, \dots, v_n$ are *linearly dependent*, then

$$
v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_n = 0 
\quad\text{in}\quad \Lambda^n(V).
$$

## 1. Linear Dependence Implies a Relation

If $v_1, \dots, v_n$ are linearly dependent, by definition there exist scalars $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n\in \mathbb{F}$, **not** all zero, such that

$$
\alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2 +\cdots+ \alpha_n v_n = 0.
$$

Without loss of generality, assume $\alpha_n \neq 0$ (if it happens that some other $\alpha_k \neq 0$, we can reorder the vectors). Then we can solve for $v_n$:

$$
v_n 
=\
-\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_n}v_1 
-\frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_n}v_2
-\dots
-\frac{\alpha_{n-1}}{\alpha_n}v_{n-1}.
$$

## 2. Substitute into the Wedge Product

We look at the wedge product

$$
v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{n-1} \wedge v_n.
$$

Using the expression for $v_n$, we get

$$
v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{n-1} \wedge 
(-\tfrac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_n}v_1 - \tfrac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_n}v_2 - \dots- \tfrac{\alpha_{n-1}}{\alpha_n}v_{n-1}).
$$

Distribute the wedge product (which is multilinear) and factor out constants:

$$
= \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 
\bigl(-\tfrac{\alpha_k}{\alpha_n}\bigr)
\Bigl(
v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{n-1} \wedge v_k
\Bigr).
$$

## 3. Antisymmetry Shows It Is Zero

Recall the **antisymmetric** property of the wedge product:
$$
x \wedge x = 0 
\quad\text{for any vector } x,
$$
and more generally, if a wedge product has two repeated factors, it is zero. 

But each term in the above sum has the form
$$
v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{k} \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{n-1} \wedge v_k,
$$
where $v_k$ is repeated. Hence each individual term is zero.

Therefore,

$$
v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{n-1} \wedge v_n = 0.
$$

This completes the proof.

## 4. Geometric/Conceptual Reason

- In the exterior power $\Lambda^n(V)$, the wedge product $v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_n$ can be seen as an “$n$-dimensional volume form” spanned by the vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n$.  
- If the vectors are linearly dependent, they do not form a full-dimensional (i.e., $n$-dimensional) parallelepiped—its “volume” is zero, and thus the wedge product is zero in $\Lambda^n(V)$.

# Summary

**Claim**: The $n$-fold wedge of $n$ linearly dependent vectors in an $n$-dimensional space is zero.  

**Reason**: If one vector is a linear combination of the others, substituting into the wedge product yields a repeated factor. Because the wedge product is alternating, any repetition makes the entire wedge product vanish.
