# Directed Polygon Area

A convex polygon in a plane is specified by the ordered set of points $\lbrace x0, x1, . . . , xn \lbrace$. Prove that the directed area of the polygon is given by

$$
A = \frac{1}{2}(x_0 \wedge x_1 + x_1 \wedge x_1 + \dotsm + x_n \wedge x_0 )
$$

What is the significance of the sign? Can you extend the idea to a triangulated surface in three dimensions?

Below is a sketch of the standard “shoelace”-type proof for the directed area formula in the plane, a discussion of the sign (orientation), and a brief explanation of how this extends to triangulated surfaces in three dimensions.

## 1. Directed Area of a Polygon in the Plane

Suppose we have a (convex) polygon in $\mathbb{R}^2$ specified by an *ordered* list of vertices

$$
\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1,\dots,\mathbf{x}_n,
$$

where each $\mathbf{x}_k = (x_k,y_k)$.  Let us write the *wedge* (or 2D cross) product of two vectors $\mathbf{u} = (u_1,u_2)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_1,v_2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by

$$
\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} = u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1.
$$

(This is sometimes denoted as a scalar “2D cross,” or the determinant of the $2\times 2$ matrix with rows $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$.)

### 1.1. Statement to Prove

We claim the (signed) area $A$ of the polygon is given by

$$
A = \frac{1}{2}\(
 \mathbf{x}_{0}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{1}
+\
\mathbf{x}_{1}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{2}
+\dots+
\mathbf{x}_{n-1}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{n}
+\
\mathbf{x}_{n}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{0}
\Bigr).
$$

### 1.2. Connection to the Shoelace Formula

In coordinates, notice that

$$
\mathbf{x}_{k}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{k+1}
=\
(x_k y_{k+1}) - (y_k x_{k+1}).
$$

Hence

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbf{x}_{k}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{k+1}
=\
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \bigl(x_k y_{k+1} - y_k x_{k+1}\bigr),
$$

where we take indices modulo $n+1$, i.e.\ $\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \mathbf{x}_{0}$.  This sum is precisely the *shoelace sum* that appears in the standard polygon area formula (sometimes called Gauss’s area formula).

1. **If the vertices $\mathbf{x}_{0},\dots,\mathbf{x}_{n}$** are listed in a *counterclockwise* (CCW) orientation, the sum is **positive**, and equals **twice** the actual geometric area.  
2. **If the vertices** are listed in a *clockwise* (CW) orientation, the sum is **negative**, and its absolute value is twice the geometric area.

Thus,

$$
\text{(directed area)} 
=\
\frac12\sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbf{x}_{k}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{k+1}.
$$

This completes the proof in two dimensions.

## 2. Significance of the Sign

- The **sign** of

$$
    \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbf{x}_{k}\wedge \mathbf{x}_{k+1}
$$
  
  depends on the ordering (orientation) of the vertices:
  - **Positive** if the polygon is traversed *counterclockwise*.  
  - **Negative** if it is traversed *clockwise*.  
- In geometric terms, we often say this is the “oriented area.”  If you reverse the order of listing the vertices, the “directed area” flips sign.

Hence the sign encodes whether the polygon is oriented CCW or CW.

## 3. Extending to a Triangulated Surface in 3D

A natural extension of this “signed/ oriented area” idea in three dimensions is via the *vector* cross product.  There are a couple of closely related notions:

1. **Oriented Area of a Single Triangle in $\mathbb{R}^3$**  
   - If a triangle has vertices $\mathbf{p}_0,\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p}_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we can define its oriented area vector to be  

$$
       \frac12\bigl( \mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{p}_0\bigr)\times\bigl(\mathbf{p}_2 - \mathbf{p}_0\bigr).
$$  

   - This vector is perpendicular to the plane of the triangle, with length = (area of triangle), and the direction given by the right-hand rule for the ordering $(\mathbf{p}_0,\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p}_2)$.

2. **Triangulated Surface**  
   - Suppose a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is broken into non-overlapping triangles (a *triangulation*).  Then each face $\Delta$ has an oriented area vector $\mathbf{A}_\Delta$.  
   - Summing these vectors over all triangles in the mesh,

$$
       \mathbf{A}_{\text{total}} 
       =\
       \sum_{\Delta} \mathbf{A}_{\Delta},
$$

  can capture the net oriented area of the whole surface.  For a *closed* surface (e.g.\ a polyhedron), this sum is related to the net flux of the outward normals and can connect to volumes via the Divergence Theorem or more discrete analogs.

3. **Oriented Volume by Tetrahedra**  
   - Analogous to the “shoelace” method for areas, one can also compute *signed volumes* in 3D by breaking a solid into tetrahedra and using the scalar triple product

     $$
       \frac16 \mathbf{x} \cdot 
       \bigl(\mathbf{y} \times \mathbf{z}\bigr)
     $$
     
     (the factor $1/6$ is the standard tetrahedron volume scale).  
   - The sign depends on the cyclic ordering (orientation) of the vertices.

Thus, the key takeaway is that **the wedge product in 2D** (or **cross product in 3D**) can be used to define *oriented measures* (length/area/volume), and by subdividing (polygon triangulation or polyhedron tetrahedralization), we can sum up these oriented contributions to get global oriented measures.  The sign encodes the orientation of each piece.

### Final Remarks

- **In 2D**: The wedge (2D cross) $\mathbf{x}\wedge \mathbf{y}$ is a scalar giving the signed area of the parallelogram spanned by $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$.  
- **In 3D**: The cross product $\mathbf{x}\times \mathbf{y}$ is a vector whose direction indicates orientation (right-hand rule) and whose magnitude is the parallelogram area.  
- By summing the local (oriented) contributions from edges/triangles/tetrahedra, we get formulas analogous to the 2D shoelace formula for more complex shapes, with sign/orientation capturing the consistent ordering of vertices.
